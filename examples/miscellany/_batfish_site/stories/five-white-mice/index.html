His hand with the long spoon was whirling swiftly, and the ice in the glass hummed and rattled like a cheap watch. Over by the window, a gambler, a millionaire, a railway conductor, and the agent of a vast American syndicate were playing seven-up. Freddie surveyed them with the ironical glance of a man who is mixing a cock-tail.</p><p>From time to time a swarthy Mexican waiter came with his tray from the rooms at the rear, and called his orders across the bar. The sounds of the indolent stir of the city, awakening from its siesta, floated over the screens which barred the sun and the inquisitive eye. From the far-away kitchen could be heard the roar of the old French chef, driving, herding, and abusing his Mexican helpers.</p><p>A string of men came suddenly in from the street. They stormed up to the bar. There were impatient shouts. &quot;Come now, Freddie, don&#x27;t stand there like a portrait of yourself. Wiggle!&quot; Drinks of many kinds and colours, amber, green, mahogany, strong and mild, began to swarm upon the bar with all the attendants of lemon, sugar, mint and ice. Freddie, with Mexican support, worked like a sailor in the provision of them, sometimes talking with that scorn for drink and admiration for those who drink which is the attribute of a good bar-keeper.</p><p>At last a man was afflicted with a stroke of dice-shaking. A herculean discussion was waging, and he was deeply engaged in it, but at the same time he lazily flirted the dice. Occasionally he made great combinations. &quot;Look at that, would you?&quot; he cried proudly. The others paid little heed. Then violently the craving took them. It went along the line like an epidemic, and involved them all. In a moment they had arranged a carnival of dice-shaking with money penalties and liquid prizes. They clamorously made it a point of honour with Freddie that he should play and take his chance of sometimes providing this large group with free refreshment. With bended heads like football players, they surged over the tinkling dice, jostling, cheering, and bitterly arguing. One of the quiet company playing seven-up at the corner table said profanely that the row reminded him of a bowling contest at a picnic.</p><p>After the regular shower, many carriages rolled over the smooth calle, and sent a musical thunder through the Casa Verde. The shop-windows became aglow with light, and the walks were crowded with youths, callow and ogling, dressed vainly according to superstitious fashions. The policemen had muffled themselves in their gnome-like cloaks, and placed their lanterns as obstacles for the carriages in the middle of the street. The city of Mexico gave forth the deep organ-mellow tones of its evening resurrection.</p><p>But still the group at the bar of the Casa Verde were shaking dice. They had passed beyond shaking for drinks for the crowd, for Mexican dollars, for dinners, for the wine at dinner. They had even gone to the trouble of separating the cigars and cigarettes from the dinner&#x27;s bill, and causing a distinct man to be responsible for them. Finally they were aghast. Nothing remained in sight of their minds which even remotely suggested further gambling. There was a pause for deep consideration.</p><p>&quot;Well——&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well——&quot;</p><p>A man called out in the exuberance of creation. &quot;I know! Let&#x27;s shake for a box to-night at the circus! A box at the circus!&quot; The group was profoundly edified. &quot;That&#x27;s it! That&#x27;s it! Come on now! Box at the circus!&quot; A dominating voice cried—&quot;Three dashes—high man out!&quot; An American, tall, and with a face of copper red from the rays that flash among the Sierra Madres and burn on the cactus deserts, took the little leathern cup and spun the dice out upon the polished wood. A fascinated assemblage hung upon the bar-rail. Three kings turned their pink faces upward. The tall man flourished the cup, burlesquing, and flung the two other dice. From them he ultimately extracted one more pink king. &quot;There,&quot; he said. &quot;Now, let&#x27;s see! Four kings!&quot; He began to swagger in a sort of provisional way.</p><p>The next man took the cup, and blew softly in the top of it. Poising it in his hand, he then surveyed the company with a stony eye and paused. They knew perfectly well that he was applying the magic of deliberation and ostentatious indifference, but they could not wait in tranquillity during the performance of all these rites. They began to call out impatiently. &quot;Come now—hurry up.&quot; At last the man, with a gesture that was singularly impressive, threw the dice. The others set up a howl of joy. &quot;Not a pair!&quot; There was another solemn pause. The men moved restlessly. &quot;Come, now, go ahead!&quot; In the end, the man, induced and abused, achieved something that was nothing in the presence of four kings. The tall man climbed on the foot-rail and leaned hazardously forward. &quot;Four kings! My four kings are good to go out,&quot; he bellowed into the middle of the mob, and although in a moment he did pass into the radiant region of exemption, he continued to bawl advice and scorn.</p><p>The mirrors and oiled woods of the Casa Verde were now dancing with blue flashes from a great buzzing electric lamp. A host of quiet members of the Anglo-Saxon colony had come in for their pre-dinner cock-tails. An amiable person was exhibiting to some tourists this popular American saloon. It was a very sober and respectable time of day. Freddie reproved courageously the dice-shaking brawlers, and, in return, he received the choicest advice in a tumult of seven combined vocabularies. He laughed; he had been compelled to retire from the game, but he was keeping an interested, if furtive, eye upon it.</p><p>Down at the end of the line there was a youth at whom everybody railed for his flaming ill-luck. At each disaster, Freddie swore from behind the bar in a sort of affectionate contempt. &quot;Why, this kid has had no luck for two days. Did you ever see such throwin&#x27;?&quot;</p><p>The contest narrowed eventually to the New York kid and an individual who swung about placidly on legs that moved in nefarious circles. He had a grin that resembled a bit of carving. He was obliged to lean down and blink rapidly to ascertain the facts of his venture, but fate presented him with five queens. His smile did not change, but he puffed gently like a man who has been running.</p><p>...</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/45524/45524-h/45524-h.htm#The-Five-White-Mice">Read the rest of this story on Project Gutenberg.</a></strong></p></div></div><div class="txt-s color-gray align-r mt12">Posted <!-- -->Aug 10, 2014</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><script>!function(r){var c=window.webpackJsonp;window.webpackJsonp=function(e,n,a){for(var i,s,o,l=0,t=[];l<e.length;l++)s=e[l],y[s]&&t.push(y[s][0]),y[s]=0;for(i in n)Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(n,i)&&(r[i]=n[i]);for(c&&c(e,n,a);t.length;)t.shift()();if(a)for(l=0;l<a.length;l++)o=m(m.s=a[l]);return o};var a={},y={manifest:0};function m(e){if(a[e])return a[e].exports;var n=a[e]={i:e,l:!1,exports:{}};return r[e].call(n.exports,n,n.exports,m),n.l=!0,n.exports}m.e=function(a){var i=y[a];if(0===i)return new Promise(function(e){e()});if(i)return i[2];var e=new Promise(function(e,n){i=y[a]=[e,n]});i[2]=e;var n=document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0],s=document.createElement("script");s.type="text/javascript",s.charset="utf-8",s.async=!0,s.timeout=12e4,m.nc&&s.setAttribute("nonce",m.nc),s.src=m.p+""+({miscellany:"miscellany","miscellany-holidays":"miscellany-holidays","miscellany-holidays-independence-day":"miscellany-holidays-independence-day","miscellany-holidays-labor-day":"miscellany-holidays-labor-day","miscellany-holidays-memorial-day":"miscellany-holidays-memorial-day","miscellany-stories":"miscellany-stories","miscellany-stories-five-white-mice":"miscellany-stories-five-white-mice","miscellany-stories-great-mistake":"miscellany-stories-great-mistake","miscellany-stories-ominous-baby":"miscellany-stories-ominous-baby","miscellany-stories-open-boat":"miscellany-stories-open-boat","miscellany-stories-wise-men":"miscellany-stories-wise-men","not-found":"not-found"}[a]||a)+"-"+{miscellany:"f76ba66255cc91f3feef","miscellany-holidays":"c2329161cff42c92ad22","miscellany-holidays-independence-day":"cd3c754e24569429cad5","miscellany-holidays-labor-day":"7db420b91e332f012b69","miscellany-holidays-memorial-day":"a639951e4a4e7a6631cb","miscellany-stories":"80ef29f1ac269e93709a","miscellany-stories-five-white-mice":"6ef6544f7ef042ad5c0a","miscellany-stories-great-mistake":"f9d05e1719ef066a1daa","miscellany-stories-ominous-baby":"bba9a71ba5b510b4f654","miscellany-stories-open-boat":"c367c08431dd02991870","miscellany-stories-wise-men":"763dadb74cc09943574d","not-found":"b7c61a5a143be1a737b3"}[a]+".chunk.js";var o=setTimeout(l,12e4);function l(){s.onerror=s.onload=null,clearTimeout(o);var e=y[a];0!==e&&(e&&e[1](new Error("Loading chunk "+a+" failed.")),y[a]=void 0)}return s.onerror=s.onload=l,n.appendChild(s),e},m.m=r,m.c=a,m.d=function(e,n,a){m.o(e,n)||Object.defineProperty(e,n,{configurable:!1,enumerable:!0,get:a})},m.n=function(e){var n=e&&e.__esModule?function(){return e.default}:function(){return e};return m.d(n,"a",n),n},m.o=function(e,n){return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,n)},m.p="/miscellany/assets/",m.oe=function(e){throw console.error(e),e}}([]);</script>
