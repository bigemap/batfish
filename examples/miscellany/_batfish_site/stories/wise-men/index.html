They were very wicked according to report, and yet they managed to have it reflect great credit upon them. They often had the well-informed and the great talkers of the American colony engaged in reciting their misdeeds, and facts relating to their sins were usually told with a flourish of awe and fine admiration.</p><p>One was from San Francisco and one was from New York, but they resembled each other in appearance. This is an idiosyncrasy of geography.</p><p>They were never apart in the City of Mexico, at any rate, excepting perhaps when one had retired to his hotel for a respite, and then the other was usually camped down at the office sending up servants with clamorous messages. &quot;Oh, get up and come on down.&quot;</p><p>They were two lads—they were called the kids—and far from their mothers. Occasionally some wise man pitied them, but he usually was alone in his wisdom. The other folk frankly were transfixed at the splendour of the audacity and endurance of these kids.</p><p>&quot;When do those boys ever sleep?&quot; murmured a man as he viewed them entering a café about eight o&#x27;clock one morning. Their smooth infantile faces looked bright and fresh enough, at any rate. &quot;Jim told me he saw them still at it about 4.30 this morning.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sleep!&quot; ejaculated a companion in a glowing voice. &quot;They never sleep! They go to bed once in every two weeks.&quot; His boast of it seemed almost a personal pride.</p><p>&quot;They&#x27;ll end with a crash, though, if they keep it up at this pace,&quot; said a gloomy voice from behind a newspaper.</p><p>The Café Colorado has a front of white and gold, in which is set larger plate-glass windows than are commonly to be found in Mexico. Two little wings of willow flip-flapping incessantly serve as doors. Under them small stray dogs go furtively into the café, and are shied into the street again by the waiters. On the side-walk there is always a decorative effect of loungers, ranging from the newly-arrived and superior tourist to the old veteran of the silver mines bronzed by violent suns. They contemplate with various shades of interest the show of the street—the red, purple, dusty white, glaring forth against the walls in the furious sunshine.</p><p>One afternoon the kids strolled into the Café Colorado. A half-dozen of the men who sat smoking and reading with a sort of Parisian effect at the little tables which lined two sides of the room, looked up and bowed smiling, and although this coming of the kids was anything but an unusual event, at least a dozen men wheeled in their chairs to stare after them. Three waiters polished tables, and moved chairs noisily, and appeared to be eager. Distinctly these kids were of importance.</p><p>Behind the distant bar, the tall form of old Pop himself awaited them smiling with broad geniality. &quot;Well, my boys, how are you?&quot; he cried in a voice of profound solicitude. He allowed five or six of his customers to languish in the care of Mexican bartenders, while he himself gave his eloquent attention to the kids, lending all the dignity of a great event to their arrival. &quot;How are the boys to-day, eh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#x27;re a smooth old guy,&quot; said one, eying him. &quot;Are you giving us this welcome so we won&#x27;t notice it when you push your worst whisky at us?&quot;</p><p>Pop turned in appeal from one kid to the other kid. &quot;There, now, hear that, will you?&quot; He assumed an oratorical pose. &quot;Why, my boys, you always get the best that this house has got.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, we do!&quot; The kids laughed. &quot;Well, bring it out, anyhow, and if it&#x27;s the same you sold us last night, we&#x27;ll grab your cash register and run.&quot;</p><p>Pop whirled a bottle along the bar and then gazed at it with a rapt expression. &quot;Fine as silk,&quot; he murmured. &quot;Now just taste that, and if it isn&#x27;t the best whisky you ever put in your face, why I&#x27;m a liar, that&#x27;s all.&quot;</p><p>The kids surveyed him with scorn, and poured their allowances. Then they stood for a time insulting Pop about his whisky. &quot;Usually it tastes exactly like new parlour furniture,&quot; said the San Francisco kid. &quot;Well, here goes, and you want to look out for your cash register.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your health, gentlemen,&quot; said Pop with a grand air, and as he wiped his bristling grey moustaches he wagged his head with reference to the cash register question. &quot;I could catch you before you got very far.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why, are you a runner?&quot; said one derisively.</p><p>&quot;You just bank on me, my boy,&quot; said Pop, with deep emphasis. &quot;I&#x27;m a flier.&quot;</p><p>...</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/45524/45524-h/45524-h.htm#The-Wise-Men">Read the rest of this story on Project Gutenberg.</a></strong></p></div></div><div class="txt-s color-gray align-r mt12">Posted <!-- -->Oct 10, 2014</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><script>!function(r){var c=window.webpackJsonp;window.webpackJsonp=function(e,n,a){for(var i,s,o,l=0,t=[];l<e.length;l++)s=e[l],y[s]&&t.push(y[s][0]),y[s]=0;for(i in n)Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(n,i)&&(r[i]=n[i]);for(c&&c(e,n,a);t.length;)t.shift()();if(a)for(l=0;l<a.length;l++)o=m(m.s=a[l]);return o};var a={},y={manifest:0};function m(e){if(a[e])return a[e].exports;var n=a[e]={i:e,l:!1,exports:{}};return r[e].call(n.exports,n,n.exports,m),n.l=!0,n.exports}m.e=function(a){var i=y[a];if(0===i)return new Promise(function(e){e()});if(i)return i[2];var e=new Promise(function(e,n){i=y[a]=[e,n]});i[2]=e;var n=document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0],s=document.createElement("script");s.type="text/javascript",s.charset="utf-8",s.async=!0,s.timeout=12e4,m.nc&&s.setAttribute("nonce",m.nc),s.src=m.p+""+({miscellany:"miscellany","miscellany-holidays":"miscellany-holidays","miscellany-holidays-independence-day":"miscellany-holidays-independence-day","miscellany-holidays-labor-day":"miscellany-holidays-labor-day","miscellany-holidays-memorial-day":"miscellany-holidays-memorial-day","miscellany-stories":"miscellany-stories","miscellany-stories-five-white-mice":"miscellany-stories-five-white-mice","miscellany-stories-great-mistake":"miscellany-stories-great-mistake","miscellany-stories-ominous-baby":"miscellany-stories-ominous-baby","miscellany-stories-open-boat":"miscellany-stories-open-boat","miscellany-stories-wise-men":"miscellany-stories-wise-men","not-found":"not-found"}[a]||a)+"-"+{miscellany:"f76ba66255cc91f3feef","miscellany-holidays":"c2329161cff42c92ad22","miscellany-holidays-independence-day":"cd3c754e24569429cad5","miscellany-holidays-labor-day":"7db420b91e332f012b69","miscellany-holidays-memorial-day":"a639951e4a4e7a6631cb","miscellany-stories":"80ef29f1ac269e93709a","miscellany-stories-five-white-mice":"6ef6544f7ef042ad5c0a","miscellany-stories-great-mistake":"f9d05e1719ef066a1daa","miscellany-stories-ominous-baby":"bba9a71ba5b510b4f654","miscellany-stories-open-boat":"c367c08431dd02991870","miscellany-stories-wise-men":"763dadb74cc09943574d","not-found":"b7c61a5a143be1a737b3"}[a]+".chunk.js";var o=setTimeout(l,12e4);function l(){s.onerror=s.onload=null,clearTimeout(o);var e=y[a];0!==e&&(e&&e[1](new Error("Loading chunk "+a+" failed.")),y[a]=void 0)}return s.onerror=s.onload=l,n.appendChild(s),e},m.m=r,m.c=a,m.d=function(e,n,a){m.o(e,n)||Object.defineProperty(e,n,{configurable:!1,enumerable:!0,get:a})},m.n=function(e){var n=e&&e.__esModule?function(){return e.default}:function(){return e};return m.d(n,"a",n),n},m.o=function(e,n){return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,n)},m.p="/miscellany/assets/",m.oe=function(e){throw console.error(e),e}}([]);</script>
