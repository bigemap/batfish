He sat most of the day in a backless chair that was placed strategically.</p><p>There was a babe living hard by, up five flights of stairs, who regarded this Italian as a tremendous being. The babe had investigated this fruit-stand. It had thrilled him as few things he had met with in his travels had thrilled him. The sweets of the world had laid there in dazzling rows, tumbled in luxurious heaps. When he gazed at this Italian seated amid such splendid treasures, his lower lip hung low and his eyes, raised to the vendor&#x27;s face, were filled with deep respect, worship, as if he saw omnipotence.</p><p>The babe came often to this corner. He hovered about the stand and watched each detail of the business. He was fascinated by the tranquillity of the vendor, the majesty of power and possession. At times he was so engrossed in his contemplation that people, hurrying, had to use care to avoid bumping him down.</p><p>He had never ventured very near to the stand. It was his habit to hang warily about the curb. Even there he resembled a babe who looks unbidden at a feast of gods.</p><p>One day, however, as the baby was thus staring, the vendor arose, and going along the front of the stand, began to polish oranges with a red pocket handkerchief. The breathless spectator moved across the side walk until his small face almost touched the vendor&#x27;s sleeve. His fingers were gripped in a fold of his dress.</p><p>At last, the Italian finished with the oranges and returned to his chair. He drew a newspaper printed in his language from behind a bunch of bananas. He settled himself in a comfortable position, and began to glare savagely at the print. The babe was left face to face with the massed joys of the world. For a time he was a simple worshipper at this golden shrine. Then tumultuous desires began to shake him. His dreams were of conquest. His lips moved. Presently into his head there came a little plan. He sidled nearer, throwing swift and cunning glances at the Italian. He strove to maintain his conventional manner, but the whole plot was written upon his countenance.</p><p>At last he had come near enough to touch the fruit. From the tattered skirt came slowly his small dirty hand. His eyes were still fixed upon the vendor. His features were set, save for the under lip, which had a faint fluttering movement. The hand went forward.</p><p>Elevated trains thundered to the station and the stairway poured people upon the sidewalks. There was a deep sea roar from feet and wheels going ceaselessly. None seemed to perceive the babe engaged in a great venture.</p><p>The Italian turned his paper. Sudden panic smote the babe. His hand dropped, and he gave vent to a cry of dismay. He remained for a moment staring at the vendor. There was evidently a great debate in his mind. His infant intellect had defined this Italian. The latter was undoubtedly a man who would eat babes that provoked him. And the alarm in the babe when this monarch had turned his newspaper brought vividly before him the consequences if he were detected. But at this moment the vendor gave a blissful grunt, and tilting his chair against a wall, closed his eyes. His paper dropped unheeded.</p><p>The babe ceased his scrutiny and again raised his hand. It was moved with supreme caution toward the fruit. The fingers were bent, claw-like, in the manner of great heart-shaking greed. Once he stopped and chattered convulsively, because the vendor moved in his sleep. The babe, with his eyes still upon the Italian, again put forth his hand, and the rapacious fingers closed over a round bulb.</p><p>And it was written that the Italian should at this moment open his eyes. He glared at the babe a fierce question. Thereupon the babe thrust the round bulb behind him, and with a face expressive of the deepest guilt, began a wild but elaborate series of gestures declaring his innocence. The Italian howled. He sprang to his feet, and with three steps overtook the babe. He whirled him fiercely, and took from the little fingers a lemon.</p><p>...</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/45524/45524-h/45524-h.htm#A-Great-Mistake">Read the rest of this story on Project Gutenberg.</a></strong></p></div></div><div class="txt-s color-gray align-r mt12">Posted <!-- -->Dec 12, 2017</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><script>!function(r){var c=window.webpackJsonp;window.webpackJsonp=function(e,n,a){for(var i,s,o,l=0,t=[];l<e.length;l++)s=e[l],y[s]&&t.push(y[s][0]),y[s]=0;for(i in n)Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(n,i)&&(r[i]=n[i]);for(c&&c(e,n,a);t.length;)t.shift()();if(a)for(l=0;l<a.length;l++)o=m(m.s=a[l]);return o};var a={},y={manifest:0};function m(e){if(a[e])return a[e].exports;var n=a[e]={i:e,l:!1,exports:{}};return r[e].call(n.exports,n,n.exports,m),n.l=!0,n.exports}m.e=function(a){var i=y[a];if(0===i)return new Promise(function(e){e()});if(i)return i[2];var e=new Promise(function(e,n){i=y[a]=[e,n]});i[2]=e;var n=document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0],s=document.createElement("script");s.type="text/javascript",s.charset="utf-8",s.async=!0,s.timeout=12e4,m.nc&&s.setAttribute("nonce",m.nc),s.src=m.p+""+({miscellany:"miscellany","miscellany-holidays":"miscellany-holidays","miscellany-holidays-independence-day":"miscellany-holidays-independence-day","miscellany-holidays-labor-day":"miscellany-holidays-labor-day","miscellany-holidays-memorial-day":"miscellany-holidays-memorial-day","miscellany-stories":"miscellany-stories","miscellany-stories-five-white-mice":"miscellany-stories-five-white-mice","miscellany-stories-great-mistake":"miscellany-stories-great-mistake","miscellany-stories-ominous-baby":"miscellany-stories-ominous-baby","miscellany-stories-open-boat":"miscellany-stories-open-boat","miscellany-stories-wise-men":"miscellany-stories-wise-men","not-found":"not-found"}[a]||a)+"-"+{miscellany:"f76ba66255cc91f3feef","miscellany-holidays":"c2329161cff42c92ad22","miscellany-holidays-independence-day":"cd3c754e24569429cad5","miscellany-holidays-labor-day":"7db420b91e332f012b69","miscellany-holidays-memorial-day":"a639951e4a4e7a6631cb","miscellany-stories":"80ef29f1ac269e93709a","miscellany-stories-five-white-mice":"6ef6544f7ef042ad5c0a","miscellany-stories-great-mistake":"f9d05e1719ef066a1daa","miscellany-stories-ominous-baby":"bba9a71ba5b510b4f654","miscellany-stories-open-boat":"c367c08431dd02991870","miscellany-stories-wise-men":"763dadb74cc09943574d","not-found":"b7c61a5a143be1a737b3"}[a]+".chunk.js";var o=setTimeout(l,12e4);function l(){s.onerror=s.onload=null,clearTimeout(o);var e=y[a];0!==e&&(e&&e[1](new Error("Loading chunk "+a+" failed.")),y[a]=void 0)}return s.onerror=s.onload=l,n.appendChild(s),e},m.m=r,m.c=a,m.d=function(e,n,a){m.o(e,n)||Object.defineProperty(e,n,{configurable:!1,enumerable:!0,get:a})},m.n=function(e){var n=e&&e.__esModule?function(){return e.default}:function(){return e};return m.d(n,"a",n),n},m.o=function(e,n){return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,n)},m.p="/miscellany/assets/",m.oe=function(e){throw console.error(e),e}}([]);</script>
